Squadzone has made an excellent tutorial and script for setting up and making CyanogenMod
I am using most of it and making some tiny changes and additions for use with the Prevail

Requirements :
1.OS linux Ubuntu 11.04 64bits ( recommended ) or above
2.2Gb RAM with 3Gb swap or above
3.Processor Centrino Duo or above
4.120Gb Harddisk or above
5.Fast internet connection

First download this file
installerBuildRomGalmin.sh
Password : squadzone

you will get installerBuildRomGalmin.sh , run this file via Terminal on Ubuntu

follow all instructions that appear, 
after Finish, now we goto download repository

still on Terminal
type


Code:
 
mkdir -p ~/cm7/system
sudo curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > /bin/repo 
sudo chmod a+x /bin/repo
cd /cm7/system
repo init -u https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android.git -b gingerbread 
repo sync -j32THIS WILL TAKE A WHILE TO FINISH

download this zip file, unzip, and copy contents into /cm7/system
prevail_cm7_config.zip
merge all folders and overwrite any files

still on Terminal
type


Code:
 
./vendor/cyanogen/get-rommanager

(ROM manager does not support our phone, but we need this file for the build to work)



Code:
 
source ./build/envsetup.sh
lunch full_prevail-eng
mka -j4 bacon
THIS WILL TAKE A WHILE TO FINISH

WHEN FINISHED YOU WILL HAVE A FOLDER
cm7/system/out/target/product/prevail
WITH A BUNCH OF GOODIES IN IT, LIKE YOUR ROM AND CWM(YES THIS MAKES CWM FOR YOU)
THE ZIP FILE update-cm-nightly-signed.zip IS THE ROM
THIS IS FLASHABLE IN CWM
I USUALLY TAKE THAT ZIP UNZIP IT AND PUT A MODDED INSTALLER SCRIPT IN IT, REMOVE ROM MANAGER, AND ADD SOME LAST MINUTE FILES AND GAPPS FILES AND SUCH


I BUILD THE ROM ODEXED BECAUSE WHEN I AM DEBUGGING THE ROM AN ODEXED ROM BOOTS SO MUCH FASTER THE FIRST TIME AND I AM CONSTANTLY REFLASHING AND WIPING TO TEST NEW 
SETTINGS

IF YOU WANT CM7 TO BUILD THE ROM DE-ODEXED FOR YOU

EDIT THIS FILE IN TEXT EDITOR

cm7/system/device/samsung/prevail/BoardConfig.mk


ON THE BOTTOM OF THE FILE LOOK FOR THIS SECTION

#JIT / Optimizations
WITH_DEXPREOPT := true
JS_ENGINE := v8


Add # so it looks like this and save the file

#JIT / Optimizations
#WITH_DEXPREOPT := true
JS_ENGINE := v8

IF YOU HAVE ALREADY COMPILED THE SOURCE AND YOU MAKE CHANGES TO THE BoardConfig.mk YOU WILL HAVE TO DO THIS FOR YOUR NEXT BUILD



Code:
 
make clobber clean
source ./build/envsetup.sh
lunch full_prevail-eng
mka -j4 bacon
